This hook pushes commit notification to the fedmsg bus to be consumed by other
applications.

It is different from the fedmsg setting present in the project options block
which publishes notifications about events happening in the project via
pagure's (web) user interface, for example: new tickets, new comments, new
pull-requests and so on.
This hook on the other hand only acts on commits.
